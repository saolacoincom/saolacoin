### get the meter
```
git clone https://github.com/saolacoincom/saolacoin-pov-consensus.git

//our next example is network warringstakes. make sure switch to release branch!!!
git checkout release
```

### build the meter

make sure you have `$GOPATH` configured

```bash
# download dependencies
make dep

# build
make or make all
```
binary is located at ./bin/meter.

#### running meter
Let's use an example as running meter in network "Herd", one of meter's internal testnet. Discover server is used in this testnet, so we do not need to configure peers.

invoke the following command. meter is running... 
```
./meter --network warringstakes --verbosity 3 --api-addr 0.0.0.0:8669 --api-cors *
```
